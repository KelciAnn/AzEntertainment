# AZEntertainment 
> A Full Stack React App using MERN tech stack geared towards sharing the entertainment venues Arizona has to offer. The team here at AZEntertainment is headed towards the ultimate finish line - going home. We hoped to share the same excitement we're feeling by creating an app that could be used to find the latest and greatest activities throughout our state, rather you live local or out of state and only traveling here for the weekend we can make your experience fun and cost effective. The team here at AZEntertainment utilized modern web development tools and languages such as; React (front-end), MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and Node.js (back-end). Our team loves to develop using React it is such a dynamic library. 

## Flow of app  
> Upon entry to open website, you have the ability to browse the events we offer - concerts, markets, and of course the more extreme side to adventure. From there you can sign up to use our service or login to your existing account where you will see previous purchases, buy tickets for upcoming events, and share your favorite event with a friend. There is a functioning event payment section upon clicking 'buy', search capabiliteis, an of course the administration analytics dashboard where we are tracking user traffic, new users, and shares. Our goal is to provide our user with an easy to use website that is constantly maintained by our admin. Also located on the admin dashboard is the forms needed to add a new event as soon as we are made aware of it. We are always improving on user experience and aim to provide our clientel with the best Arizona has to offer.

## Responsibilites 

> **Dre Caron** dug in deep merging the front-end and back-end to make a seemless flow not only for the team but for our user experience aswell! Creating the schema models, database, model routes, payment logic, the user verifictions and component, mapping components, and photo mapping in the database. 

> **Davina Dacpano** worked tirelessly to design the most amazing website with the full capabilities of user friendly interactions, creating her own logic and way of implementing the ideas she had along the way. The ability to express her creative side was all she needed and in having the freedom to do so designed our amazing logo along side Dre Caron, the clickable tabs, and so so much more. 

> **Vanessa Bella** jumped right into the extreme adventure idea! Working on this page from the front-end to the back-end, finding any and every extreme adventure you could have in our state of wonders along the way. Vanessa was intrigued by the full scope of her ability to expand her knowlegde and have the freedom to work on her own side of the business.

> **Kelci Fowler** dove right into creating the content, data, and administration components. Expanding on her ability to create insightful and at times comical content for the user was an exciting journey. Being the creator of the administration section was the best part. Collecting the data from the users to expand on the company growth and user experience was important from all angels of the project. Working on the logic of it along side Dre was a learning experience I won't forget, giving me an understanding I believe I lacked prior to this. I relish the opportunity to organize, brain storm, and generally lead us to our shared goal.
